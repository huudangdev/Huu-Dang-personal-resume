I'm fascinated by creativity, always looking for excitement in each project. I was fortunate to find the passion of programming early, so every day i try to be more professional. I'm addicted to books and spend a lot of time with them. Moreover, jogging is the sport I feel fit. In my free time, I learn culture and history.",
